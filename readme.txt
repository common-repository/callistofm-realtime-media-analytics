Realtime audio and video analytics. This plugin will detect most YouTube, Vimeo, HTML5,
and VideoJS videos as well as SoundCloud HTML5 widgets.

== Description ==

Callisto.fm's WordPress plugin works by including a javascript library that checks each page's HTML for video and audio
players and then listens for user events like "play", "pause", "finish", and "fullscreen". These events are sent to
Callisto's API where they are recorded for later analysis. You can then login to Callisto.fm and see realtime and
historical charts that allow you to better understand how your visitors are engaging with your media.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `/callisto-analytics` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Check that your domain is set correctly in the Callisto Analytics settings.
4. Create an account with Callisto.fm and login to view your analytics dashboard.
